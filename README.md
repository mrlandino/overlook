## Introduction
The Overlook project was a solo assignment for Turing School of Software and Design's Front End Module 2. This site allows a user to sign in and book hotel rooms based on preference. Users have the ability to filter through rooms via date as well as roomType.

The goals for this project included incorporating Fetch calls and interaction with a backend API. I wrote test files for each class and the method within those classes - getting more comfortable with Mocha and Chai in the process.

The biggest wins was being able to complete this project exactly how I wanted it to be in the time that we had, becoming more familiar with fetch requests, and gaining a deeper understanding of real-world application of iterator methods.

My biggest challenge was grasping the vastness of the project. In comparison to  previous works, this project is significantly larger in scale and complexity. Also, being able to write this whole application from scratch was another big challenge.


## Learning Goals
  - Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
  - Practice iterator methods to perform data manipulation in an effort to achieve desired functionalities.
  - Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application
  - Work with an API to send and receive data

## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Mocha
  - Chai
  - Fetch API
  - Webpack
  - NPM
  - Lighthouse (accessibility)

## Features
- When a user loads the browser, they will see a login page that allows them to sign in with provided credentials. For this application you can use a username: customer1-customer50 and I have created a master password of "overlook2021" for the time being.
- They are able to access their dashboard which shows all of their bookings past and present.
- From there the user has the ability to click on the "Book a Room" button to book a desired room.
- While on the book a room page, the user can sort through bookings by date as well as room type if desired.
- After you have booked a room the card will disappear and the user can then go back to their bookings page or book more rooms.
- When the user is finished they can "logout" at any point.
